    Radiation therapy protocols for lung cancer treatment planning commonly use a
    3D CT image  to delineate critical regions of interest and a  4D
    respiratory-gated CT  to  track  tumor respiratory motion. 4D CT data sets
    contain a great deal of information and can be analyzed to obtain
    quantitative data on respiratory system dynamics, mechanics, and function. We
    describe a method that transfers  segmentation contours from the 3D planning
    CT to  the entire 4D data set, even though the lung  changes  size and shape
    during image acquisition due to respiration. Our proposed method uses
    deformable image registration to align all phases of the 4D CT into the
    coordinate system of the 3D planning CT\@. A graph optimization algorithm is
    used to  segment the lung boundaries of the aligned phases of the 4D data
    set. The algorithm is initialized with the 3D segmentation of the planning
    CT. The segmentations of the individual phases in the planning CT coordinate
    system  are then transformed back into  each of the original phase coordinate
    systems  providing 3D segmented volumes at each phase of the 4D CT\@. We
    tested  the method on six data sets from subjects about to undergo radiation 
    therapy for lung cancer. For each subject a 3D planning CT was segmented as
    part of the treatment planning process. This planning CT was used to segment
    the 4D CT at ten phase points across the respiratory cycle. The results of
    our method were compared against manual segmentations of four phases giving
    an average surface distance of 0.417 mm and average Dice coefficient of
    0.983.  The 4D segmentations appear to be more consistent across phases than 
    the manual segmentations, especially near the mediastinum. The results show
    that this method can provide accurate 4D segmentations from a single
    segmented 3D CT image."

ABSTRACT={SimpleITK is a new interface to the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) designed to facilitate rapid prototyping, education and scientific activities via high level programming languages. ITK is a templated C++ library of image processing algorithms and frameworks for biomedical and other applications, and it was designed to be generic, flexible and extensible. Initially, ITK provided a direct wrapping interface to languages such as Python and Tcl through the WrapITK system. Unlike WrapITK, which exposed ITK's complex templated interface, SimpleITK was designed to provide an easy to use and simplified interface to ITK's algorithms. It includes procedural methods, hides ITK's demand driven pipeline, and provides a template-less layer. Also SimpleITK provides practical conveniences such as binary distribution packages and overloaded operators. Our user-friendly design goals dictated a departure from the direct interface wrapping approach of WrapITK, toward a new facade class structure that only exposes the required functionality, hiding ITK's extensive template use. Internally SimpleITK utilizes a manual description of each filter with code-generation and advanced C++ meta-programming to provide the higher-level interface, bringing the capabilities of ITK to a wider audience. SimpleITK is licensed as open source software library under the Apache License Version 2.0 and more information about downloading it can be found at http://www.simpleitk.org.}}
