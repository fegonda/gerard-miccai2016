\begin{abstract}
Lung segmentation is a critical initial step in planning radiation therapy interventions for lung cancer patients. Achieving robust automatic segmentation of lungs with large tumors is challenging due to large variations in lung morphology, tumor location, and tumor shape between subjects. We present an automatic method to segment lungs with large tumors in CT images using an initial intensity based segmentation followed by alpha shape construction and graph search. We evaluated our method by comparing automated segmentations to manual segmentations on twelve subjects. Computed metrics for segmentation quality include average surface distance of 0.727 and average DICE coefficient of 0.970. These results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately segments the entire lung regions both absent of and in the presence of large tumors.

\section{Introduction}
%
Radiation therapy interventions of lung cancer patients involve acquiring a thoracic CT scan to assess the disease state and to design a patient specific treatment plan. Typically a respiratory correlated scan, or 4D CT, is also acquired prior to treatment. This produces a huge amount of data, requiring automatic computer-aided methods for further analysis. Accurate delineation of the lungs is a critical initial first step for treatment planning and quantitative analysis.

Normal lung tissue has high contrast with the surrounding anatomy, making lung segmentation relatively robust using simple thresholding based methods~\cite{guo2008,hu2001}. However, in the presence of large tumors, conventional threshold based methods fail because the radiodense tumors are excluded from the segmentation. An accurate lung tissue segmentation including the tumor is required during radiation therapy planning, e.g., to predict the dose delivered to the normal lung tissue and the tumor or to perform tissue motion or biomechanical analyses.

Several approaches have been used to segment pathological lungs. Statistical shape models (SSM) have bee used to capture the major modes of lung shape variation in a training set used to build a lung model~\cite{sofka2011,sun2012}. The SSM method, however, requires a large training set with annotated manually identified corresponding landmark points. Additionally, the SSM training set is limited to a subset of possible lung shape variations and thus it often fails on cases that are not represented in the training set. Segmentation by registration methods~\cite{sluimer2005,vanrikxoort2009} make use an atlas or multiple atlases with ground truth segmentations. The atlas segmentation is mapped to a test case using image registration. Atlas based segmentations require prohibitively time consuming registration to get adequate results. Recently, machine learning based methods have been proposed to classify pathological lung tissue~\cite{mansoor2014,song2012}

In this paper we propose an alpha shape approach for inclusion of large tumors in lung segmentations. The concept of using alpha shapes to represent a point set was originally presented in~\cite{edelsbrunner1983}. In~\cite{stelldinger2006}, alpha shapes were used for boundary reconstruction of shapes in 2D images. In~\cite{cerrolaza2015} alpha shapes were used to generate patient specific maps for renal segmentation in 3D ultrasound images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that alpha shapes have been applied to the problem of lung segmentation. 


%
\section{Methods}
%
The proposed method has three main steps: an initial intensity based segmentation, an alpha shape computation of initial mask, and an optimal graph search for final refinement. Each of these steps will be described next.
%
\subsection{Initial Segmentation}
%

First, we obtain an initial segmentation of the lungs using an intensity-based approach~\cite{guo2008}. The method from~\cite{guo2008} consists of three main steps: extraction of lungs using optimal thresholding, separation of the right and left lungs, and optimal smoothing to smooth the lung boundaries. This gives separate masks for both left and right normal lung tissue lung, however large dense tumors are not included in the segmentation. We will refer to this result as the initial mask. The next steps will process initial masks for the left and right lung separately. 
%
\subsection{Alpha Shapes}
%
 Given a finite set of points $P \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $ 0 \leq \alpha \leq \infty $, an $\alpha$-shape is one way to represent the shape of $P$. If $\alpha = \infty$, the $\alpha$-shape is equivalent to the convex hull of $P$. A family of shapes can be obtained by varying $\alpha$; as $\alpha$ decreases the $\alpha$-shape gradually becomes more constricted to a tighter fit around $P$.

The Delaunay triangulation of a point set can be used to calculate the $\alpha$ -shape.  The Delaunay triangulation of a point set $DT(P)$ is the triangulation that maximizes the minimum angle of each d-simplex $t \in DT(P)$. Note: in 2D and 3D the d-simplices $t$ are triangles and tetrahedrons, respectively. $DT(P)$ is the dual graph of the Voronoi diagram of $P$. The $\alpha$-shape consists of a subset of d-simplices $t \in DT(P)$, it is the union of d-simplices $t \in DT(P)$ with circumsphere radius $R_c(t) \leq \alpha$.The surface mesh representation of the $\alpha$-shape consists of all boundary facets of these d-simplices. The Delaunay triangulation and $\alpha$-shape calculation is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:star} using a toy example and Figure~\ref{fig:tris} using a 2D lung example.

As $\alpha$ decreases, triangles are removed that have a circumcircle with radius greater than $\alpha$. For each example, the $\alpha$-shape is the union of all triangles.}
  \label{fig:star}
\end{figure}

The lung shape is approximately convex along the pleural surface, so the convex hull of the initial mask gives a good estimate of the boundary for this surface, even in presence of large chest wall tumors. However, the mediastinum and diaphragm regions are not convex so the convex hull oversegments these regions. $\alpha$-shapes allow us to elegantly obtain a family of shapes that smoothly interpolates between the convex hull and initial mask to represent the lung shape. 


As the $\alpha$-shape is defined on a point set, rather than an image, first we obtain a set of points $p \in P$ representing the initial mask. We could use the physical locations of all image voxels in the mask as our point set, however for time efficiency we chose to only take a sample of these voxels. We performed image erosion and subtraction operations to generate a set of concentric contours of the initial mask and used these voxel locations for $P$. To ensure all of the initial mask is included in the $\alpha$-shape, the separation between concentric contours needs to be small enough such that the d-simplices formed between contours have a circumradius smaller than $\alpha$. 


There is a trade off between oversegmentation and undersegmentation when choosing $\alpha$. If $\alpha$ is too large, the mediastinum is oversegmented, however decreasing $\alpha$ too much can remove tumors (Figure~\ref{fig:alphashapes}).  We experimented with different values of $\alpha$ to obtain lung shapes thate included tumor regions and minimized oversegmentation near the diaphragm and mediastinum. The diaphragm is easily removed due to the broad concave structure, however the mediastinum has many very small concavities resulting in minor oversegmentation that cannot be removed without removing the tumor. We empirically determined $ \alpha=25 $ to give good results for all subjects in this study. Prior to the next step, we performed Laplacian smoothing~\cite{herrmann1976} on the alpha shape surface to remove sharp edges.

\subsection{Graph Search}
%
To reduce minor mediastinum oversegmentation resulting from small concavities, we use a graph search framework to find the optimal lung surface. The method will only briefly be described here; see~\cite{li2006} for a detailed description of the method. 

The graph search method requires a shape prior, here we use the alpha shape from the previous step as the shape prior. A graph $G(E,V)$ consisting of node set $V$ and edge set $E$ is built in a margin around the shape prior. The nodes have an associated cost reflecting the unlikeliness that it belongs to the lung surface. We use the inverse gradient of the CT image for the cost, as the lung surface has a high image gradient. Edges are used to enforce smoothness constraints, or how much the topology of the resulting segmentation can deviate from the shape prior. The globally optimal surface is obtained by using a maximum flow algorithm on a closely derived graph. 

As a final step we performed a logical OR operation between the graph search result and the initial mask. This adds back in sharp edges, such as those at the costophrenic angle, that are lost when the smoothing is performed.

\section{Data Sets and Experimental Setup}
%
In this study we used breath-hold thoracic CT scans from twelve lung cancer subjects about to undergo radiation therapy. All scans were gathered under a protocol approved by the 
XXXXXXXXXXX YYYYYYY 
%University of Iowa 
Institutional Review Board 
%(IRB 200905703). 
(IRB ZZZZZZZZZ).
All images were resampled from $0.98\times{}0.98\times{}2$ mm$^3$ to obtain $1\times{}1\times{}1$ mm$^3$ isotropic voxels. We chose 11 subjects that had a large lung tumor in either the left or right lung, and one subject with no lung tumors.

Our method was evaluated by comparing to manual segmentations generated by a radiation therapy physicist using the MimVista 6.4.7 software (MIM Software, Cleveland, OH) following a protocol similar to that used for radiation therapy planning. The DICE coefficient was used for a metric of volume overlap, and the average unsigned symmetric surface distance was used to measure the distance between the lung boundaries. The analysis was performed on both the left and right lungs of all subjects. Additionally, we compared the results of lungs with and without tumors.


The proposed method was implemented using the jupyter notebook~\cite{PER-GRA:2007} rapid prototyping environment,  algorithms from ITK~\cite{johnson2015itk} python wrapped in SimpleITK~\cite{10.3389/fninf.2013.00045} in coordination with vtkDelaunay3D from VTK (www.vtk.org).

\section{Discussion}
%

The method shows good results with an average unsigned surface distance of 0.727 mm and an average DICE coefficient of 0.970 for all subjects. This surface distance is on the sub-voxel level. Additionally, we split the lungs into tumor and non-tumor groups. The DICE coefficient was 0.967 and 0.971 for tumor and non-tumor groups, respectively. The average unsigned surface distance was 0.758 mm and 0.702 mm for tumor and non-tumor groups, respectively. A t-test was performed to compare the surface distance error for lungs with tumors and lungs without tumors and no significant difference was found (p-value = 0.314). The surface distance for the initial mask was 1.368 mm and 0.710 mm for tumor and non-tumor groups, respectively. These results show that compared to the initial mask, our method significantly improves the average surface distance error for lungs with tumors (p-value 0.0008) and does not significantly change the average surface distance error for lungs without tumors (p-value 0.867).

By visual inspection, it is clear that the majority of the discrepancy between our results and the manual segmentations occur at the mediastinum. This is a subjective region to segment, as can be observed on coronal slices of the manual segmentations. The manual segmentations were done on transverse slices and variation on where the mediastinal boundary was define between slices resulted in the boundary not being smooth in 3D. The proposed method produces a smooth mediastinum boundary that is consistent between subjects. 

In future work we plan on identifying the optimal $\alpha$ for each subject rather than using the same $\alpha$ for all subjects. Additionally, we plan to experiment with automatically identifying a spatially varying alpha to overcome over segmentation near mediastinum.

The experiments were run on a Linux machine with an Intel Xeon 2.27 GHz CPU and 48 GB of RAM. Generating the alpha shape and the graph search take approximately 13 and 1 minute(s) of computer time, respectively. The manual segmentation took on average 53 minutes per subject.
%
\section{Summary}
%
We proposed a method for segmentation of lungs in the presence of large tumors. The method utilizes an intensity based segmentation, alpha shapes correction, and a graph search framework final refinement. An average surface error distance of 0.727 mm and DICE coefficient of 0.970 and  were achieved. The accurate lung segmentation with  inclusion of tumor regions is valuable for radiation therapy treatment planning and further quantitative analysis.
