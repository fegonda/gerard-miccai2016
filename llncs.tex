\begin{abstract}
Lung segmentation is a critical initial step for radiation therapy interventions of lung cancer patients. However, automatic segmentation of lungs with large tumors is a challenging task due to the large variation of both lung and tumor shape between subjects. We present a method that utilizes alpha shapes to automatically segment lungs with large tumors in CT images.

\section{Introduction}
%
Radiation therapy interventions of lung cancer patients involve acquiring a thoracic CT scan. Typically a respiratory correlated scan, or 4D CT, is also acquired prior to treatment. This produces a huge amount of data, requiring automatic computer-aided methods for further analysis. Accurate delineation of the lungs is a critical initial first step for treatment planning and lung function analysis using image registration.

Normal lungs have high contrast with the surrounding anatomy, making lung segmentation relatively trivial using thresholding based methods ~\cite{guo2008,hu2001}. However, in the presence of large tumors, conventional threshold based methods fail because tumors are excluded from the segmentation.

Several approaches have been used to segment pathological lungs. Statistical shape models are able to capture the major modes of lung shape variation in a training set and then build a lung model ~\cite{sun2012,sofka2011}. This method requires a large training set with annotated corresponding landmark points. Additionally, the training set is limited to a subset of possible lung shape variations and thus it could fail on cases that are not represented in the training set. Segmentation by registration methods ~\cite{sluimer2005,vanrikxoort2009} make use an atlas or multiple atlases with ground truth segmentations. The atlas segmentation is mapped to a test case using image registration. For good results, a time consuming registration is needed.

In this paper we propose an alpha shape approach for inclusion of large tumors in lung segmentations. 

Blah I feel like crap I'm going home.

\section{Methods}
%

%
\subsection{Initial Segmentation}
%
Describe Junfeng's segmentation here.
%
\subsection{Alpha Shape}
%
Delaunay triangulation, convex hull, alpha shapes
%
\subsection{Graph Search}
%
Optimal surface finding fun!
%
\section{Data Sets and Experimental Setup}
%
Using the jupyter notebook \cite{PER-GRA:2007} rapid prototyping environmnet,  algorithms from ITK\cite{johnson2015itk} python wrapped in SimpleITK \cite{10.3389/fninf.2013.00045} in coordination with vtkDelaunay3D from VTK (www.vtk.org).

In this study we used breath-hold thoracic CT scans from twelve lung cancer subjects
about to undergo radiation therapy. All scans were gathered under a protocol approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board (IRB 200905703). All images were resampled to obtain $1\times{}1\times{}1$ mm$^3$ voxels. Ground truth segmentations were generated by an expert on XXX transverse slices per subject using XXX software.

\section{Discussion}
%
The experiments were run on a Linux machine with an Intel Xeon 2.27 GHz CPU and 48 GB of RAM. Generating the alpha shape and the graph search takes XXX and XXX minutes of computer time, respectively. The manual segmentation took on average XXX per lung.
